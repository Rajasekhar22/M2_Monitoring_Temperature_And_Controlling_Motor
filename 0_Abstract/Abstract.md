# ABSTRACT
      
  This project is based on Controlling two more motors by using Temperature using DHT22/11 sensor/Temperature sensor(Thermister). For Ac motors, we can use Relays to run another motor by energising the coil. For monitoring the Temperature, LCD 16x2 panel is used. This control of the motor using temperature is very much useful to control the motor in the industry. Industries, where there is a requirement for continuous operation of motors, can use this project. To prevent the motor from producing high heat and harmonics we go for controlling the motor using temperature. We can also be able to monitor the status of the motor using the LED provided to it. To improve the performance of the operation we can also use the timers to operate the motor by taking statistics of some reading provided by a sensor concerning the motor. This is project mainly gives safety to motors to prevent from damage and explode.
