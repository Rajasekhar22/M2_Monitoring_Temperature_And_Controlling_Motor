## Installation Softwares

*   VISUAL STUDIO CODE.
*   LINUX (latest version preferred "UBUNTU").
*   Rather than going to install LINUX OS in BIOS, you can also use VIRTUAL BOX to run LINUX in WINDOWS.
*   GitHub desktop(To push and pull the changes without command through GIT BASH).
*   Dr.Memory(Memory check).

## FLOWCHART

* CONTROLLING MOTOR USING TEMPERATURE

* TEMPERATURE MONITORING

![MONITOR_TEMPERATURE](https://github.com/Rajasekhar22/image/blob/main/TEMP.jpeg)


## PROCEDURE

* Temperature Monitoring
  * Temperature sensor(DHT22/11) is interfaced with the Atmega328 microcontroller chip.
  * In which it measures the temperature with some delay mentioned frequently and gives signals to MCU.
  * It is connected to PORT C for Analog to Digital conversion.
  * Using formulae the digital values are converted into deg. Celsius.
  * Now the temperature is displayed in LCD.

* Controlling motor
  * When Switch is in off condition Motor 2 is On and LED 2 will be glowing.
  * when Switch is in On Condition Motor 1 is On and LED 1 will be glowing.


## For Testing and using code

* Preferable Coding Software for Avr Coding is Microchip studio.
* You have to use C compiler with MINGGW(latest or the previous versions).
* Set path for MINGGW in Environment variables.
* To go with best compiler use VISUAL STUDIO CODE.
* In Visual Studio code you can also RUN the program in both LINUX and WINDOWS.
* Unit testing is done for Linux.
