# Requirements

##  Feautures
  * Easy in controlling two motors in an industry.
  * Monitoring of temperature made easy.
  * Automatic controlling using teperature.

## Research
  * Referred many Arduino temperature measurement based projects.
  * Referred many e-sources for coding part.
       
##  Key feautures
  * Intimates while change in motor with respect to temperature.

# The 4W's and a H 

## WHAT
  * It is the controlling of two motors based on temperature.
## WHY
  * The main objective of this project is to control the motor's based on their respective temperature.
## WHO
  * Industries who require continuos operation of motors/load based components to get their profits.
## WHERE
  * This project mainly comes in use at Small scale/Large scale industries.
## HOW
  * This project is implemented using "Embedded C Program" based on AVR programming.

# SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
 ## STRENGTHS:
   * Easily Operating.
   * Platform Independant.
 ## WEAKNESS:
   * Controlling using WEB.
 ## THREATS:
   * If sensors are failed to operate motors may get overheated.
